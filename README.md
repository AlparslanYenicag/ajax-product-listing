# AJAX Product Listing

This is a simple **product listing interface** built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
The project dynamically fetches product data from a local `products.json` file and renders it onto the page using **AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)**.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with:
- Fetching data asynchronously using AJAX
- Reading and parsing JSON
- Manipulating the DOM to display data dynamically

It was created as part of a front-end bootcamp assignment, but also served as a **personal practice** to better understand real-world data flow in client-side applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)  
- JSON (local file)

## üß© Key Features

- Dynamically fetches and displays products from a local JSON file  
- Clean, functional layout with basic styling  
- Responsive to different amounts of data

## üß† What I Learned

- How to perform asynchronous operations using XMLHttpRequest  
- Structuring JSON for use in UI rendering  
- Basic UI layout with dynamically populated content

## üëÄ Why This Project Matters

While simple in scope, this project reflects my ongoing effort to **learn and apply fundamental frontend concepts**.  
Rather than just completing exercises, I try to turn each project into a working, usable demo ‚Äî and this is one of them.
